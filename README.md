# Design Course - The UI/UX Crash Course for 2023 - Learn UI/UX

## Development of Fauxica Sports Home Page

This project is a html page based on the figma prototype created in the UI/UX crash course found in the [Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/@DesignCourse) youtube channel.

Up to this point, I've wrote the html and css of the page, with the intent of practicing frontend development, and learning from the process. It's a simple home page, with no functionality.

There's a video made by Design Course in which the tutor, Gary Simon, writes the html and css code, but I have not followed the instructions on that video, because I wanted to see if I could fully develop the page, or at least code something close to the initial design. Up to the first commit, I've wrote everything without following any step by step tutorial.

I have used media queries to make the design responsive, with some informal tests, using the developer tools of Google Chrome and by sending the link of the page to some friends to open on their mobile devices.

I've had no part in the creation of the design, I've just tried to translate the design to code.
